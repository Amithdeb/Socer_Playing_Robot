# Socer_Playing_Robot
As a projectwork of a course,we designed a Soccer robot.
Basically, this soccer robot does not refer to a robot that has feet and hands but rather a car automated by servo motors which were programmed to kick a ball.
There,we used a arduino uno board,bluetooth module,servo motors,motor driver etc. 
There is given a short video of our project as a proof of accomplishment of the project successfully.
